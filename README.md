# QuickVoid ðŸ•³ [1.8x - 1.18x]
A small plugin for Spigot servers that allows admins to create void worlds without using a plugin implemented chunks generator. In other words, you don't have to install any plugins to load worlds created with QuickVoid after having created them once, because they are similar to the vanilla ones. Furthermore, technically it takes less time to load them.

Use `/qv create <world_name>` to create a void world. You need a `quickvoid.admin` permission to do that.
